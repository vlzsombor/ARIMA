    * Publishing [this](https://zsvl.wordpress.com/2024/11/06/my-confusion-about-the-video-building-a-neural-network-from-scratch/) blog post
    * [Continuing supervised machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/10ZVv/choosing-the-learning-rate), watching week 2 Gradient descent in practice video 1,2,3
  * Thursday (7. Nov)
    * Finishing the week two of [supervised machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/10ZVv/choosing-the-learning-rate) 
    * I'll continue with the Week2/C1W2A1/C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb. Coursere writes it takes 3 hourse to complete.
  * Friday (8. Nov):
    * I finished  the _C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb_ 
      * It was not 3 hours, I hid the code and did the exercises by my own
      * There was a lot of ready to use code, I don't feel I fully grasped every idea, but it will be a nice reference.
  * Sat (9. Nov):
    * Watching week 3 until the cost function, the last episode is a bit confusing (simplified)
    * Write a post draft to the blog
