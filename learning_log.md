* week 45:
  * Wednesday (6. Nov)
    * Publishing [this](https://zsvl.wordpress.com/2024/11/06/my-confusion-about-the-video-building-a-neural-network-from-scratch/) blog post
    * [Continuing supervised machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/10ZVv/choosing-the-learning-rate), watching week 2 Gradient descent in practice video 1,2,3
  * Thursday (7. Nov)
    * Finishing the week two of [supervised machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/10ZVv/choosing-the-learning-rate) 
    * I'll continue with the Week2/C1W2A1/C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb. Coursere writes it takes 3 hourse to complete.
  * Friday (8. Nov):
    * I finished  the _C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb_ 
      * It was not 3 hours, I hid the code and did the exercises by my own
      * There was a lot of ready to use code, I don't feel I fully grasped every idea, but it will be a nice reference.
  * Sat (9. Nov):
    * Watching week 3 until the cost function, the last episode is a bit confusing (simplified)
    * Write a post draft to the blog
    * ======(This long means pause)
    * After a long pause I rewatched the simplification video and it is clear now.
  * Sun (10. Nov):
    * I finished the supervised machine learning course
    * The gradient descent calculation of the regulaziation was harder to understand
    * I can continue with the next course of the specialization :)))
  
  Week 46:
  
  * Monday (11. Nov):
    * Starting [Advanced algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms/home/week/1) week1, Neural network intuition
  * Tue (12. Nov)
    * Watching Neural network model part, it is sort of obvious because I already watched the neural network on scratch.
    * Watching TensorFlow implementation vido until Building a neural network
  * Wed (13. Nov)
    * Finishing TensorFlow implementation part and studying roasting coffee with tensorflow project
  * Friday (15. Nov)
    * Studying CoffeeRoastingNumpy notebook
    * AGI video, human intelligence and neural network analog
    * Starting Vectorization first video 
  * Sunday (17. Nov):
    * Publishing an article about week1
    * Watching week 2 until Back propagation
  
  Week 47:
  
  * Monday (18. Nov)
    * Watching week 2, derivate video in back propagation (super intuitive)
    * Watching the integration video on youtube
  * Tuesday (19. Nov)
    * Finishing Back propgation chapter
