Transfer learning

It means to reuse an already existing model. For example, a model that detects animals is also useful for text detection. There are two ways to apply transfer learning.

Only train the output layer's parameter (for smaller models)

train all parameters but using the initial values (bigger models)

With this approach, you don't have to start from scratch. You can stand on the shoulders of giants by using the already pre-trained model.
